###  Technical

I wanted to produce this site using as little money as possible but at the same time have a site that was very fast to load for my readers and with a simple design.

The content of *Incidental Notes* is put together for publication on the web using [Hugo][1], the excellent open source 'static site generator' created by Steve Francia. [Hugo][1] is a truly remarkable resource and I would like to thank Steve for his work in making this technology freely available.

I also use [John Otander's][2] css toolkit [Tachyons][3], that is designed to 'create fast loading, highly readable, and 100% responsive interfaces with as little css as possible.'
