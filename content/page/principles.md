The following are a set of principles that govern this blog:

* The details of my own journey should be completely authentic and be verifiable to those who personally know me. When I fall short I’ll be honest about it.
* I will speak in my own voice and from my own experience.
* I won’t “monetise” this blog by advertising anything I don’t believe in.
* The work of others will always be fully attributed.
