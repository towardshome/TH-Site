One of the guiding principles of this blog is that it reflects my own struggles and successes, and that by being honest about them I might in some way help others. With that in mind let's talk about overeating and excess weight. It is such a tragedy that while so many in the world live in hunger, others spend time and resources trying to combat the excessive weight gain caused by eating too much. It's a problem that seems to be getting worse.

I'm overweight myself and I imagine that's one of the reasons (though not the main one) why I'm writing this blog. My own view is that this problem in my life, and in the lives of many others, is rooted in something deep inside us and is a symptom of a compelling hunger we have, not for food or drugs, but for love (and we might just as easily substitute over eating here with any other kind of over consumption). <!--more--> 

I'd make some other quick points:

- Excess weight is a very visible sign of over consumption and is often criticised by others who over consume in less obvious ways (for example by buying expensive and unnecessary clothes, using large amounts of limited fossil fuels in aircraft flights, by smoking or by taking more than they need in a myriad of other ways).
- Having excess weight doesn't make you a bad person anymore than not being over weight makes you a good one.
- We don't have to live a life of miserable 'white knuckle' discipline to overcome this problem.
- Over eating is nearly always a symptom of a disorder, and that disorder is often separation from that which truly makes us truly happy.

The only way for me to have credence in my own analysis of this problem (and to be in any position to help others) is to undertake to address this problem myself and be honest with you in the process. This blog is a way in which I can make an account of that journey, not only my quest to combat unmindful consumption, but also to find stillness and joy in the world.

So, let me tell you where I'm up to in relation to overeating. Since puberty I have struggled with my weight. Like many of us it has been up and down but generally it has varied between being 'plump' to being fat. I've never been huge, but I often eat too much, and that greedy consumption often makes me ashamed, especially of taking more than I should of a precious resource that others have had to make sacrifices to provide (and by others I include our brothers and sisters in the animal world) . I've tried a variety of things but never with too much success. I realise now they might never have worked because I was approaching it in a wrong headed way. My overeating can't be separated from the rest of my life but is a symptom of a fundamental unhappiness or discontent. It's interwoven with a collection of behaviour (including drinking too much alcohol) that arises from a kind of homesickness. To help in this, as in so much else, I need to get closer to home, and that home is God. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming to have any answers about what God is, and I'm not coming from any particularly religious angle. What I understand currently by God is that sense, prevalent yet maddeningly elusive, that is somehow the love and creative principle behind everything. Whatever that might be it has been calling me my whole life and it is my failure to respond as I should that has led to a sense of absence in my life that in turn leads to such things as me eating or drinking too much. The plain and simple truth (and I can't help but believe this is the same for millions of others) is that what is often interpreted as greed is in fact the repeated clumsy and unconscious desire to satisfy a yearning that will never be satisfied by transitory pleasure.

I'm going to come now to practicalities. I'm currently about two stones over weight (that's a UK measure of course, equivalent to about 28 pounds in the US). I vow to return to my normal weight by trying as hard as I can to  practice the following (and I am going to update this page about once a month with my progress).

###  Practice (reminder to self)

- Do all I can to move closer to where my true home resides(with the complication of course that I don't claim to know what God is or isn't - see above).
- Remember that what I take from the world I am taking in some way from others (including animals). 
- Remember that I am I loved
- Eat mindfully (when I take food and drink think where it came from and the processes and sacrifices that were taken to make it). 
- Savour and enjoy what I eat and drink.
- Be grateful.

I know this is something I'll be coming back to so I'll leave it at that.
