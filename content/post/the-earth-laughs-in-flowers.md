The popular quote "The earth laughs in flowers" is, I believe,  from [Ralph Waldo Emerson's][2] poem Hamatreya. It's a beautiful phrase and I took the liberty of using it in the poem below.

> 'The earth laughs in flowers'     
> Green shoot of snowbell grins,     
> Trusting against the frost     
> With optimistic fragility.     
> <!--more-->
> 'The earth laughs in flowers'     
> Abandoning herself in rain.     
> Generosity in bloom,     
> Strewn across the desert.     
>      
> The earth laughs in flowers.     
> And dances with bees.     
> Courts with the grasses,     
> Smiles wood anemone in the forest.     
>      
> Does she frown at the concrete     
> Or grimace at the oil?     
> Weep with the plastic     
> and the choke of litter?     
>
> *Simon W. Jones*
