I recently enjoyed an early morning walk near [Minsmere][1] in Suffolk. The land was touched with a heavy dew and the silence seemed deeper than usual, the bird song louder, my presence more accepted. The stillness encouraged the recognition of connectedness, and it seemed that my sense of awareness and anticipation, time itself, was more luminous and authentic. I am sure many of you will recognise the feeling I am trying to explain and would seek, as I do, to encourage it's presence in their life.

I have taken many photographs in Suffolk, a county I love visiting and will return to again, but I would give them all to have one that reflected a sense of that early walk. I did stop to take photographs, and at the time felt they might reflect some of the beauty of the day, but when I looked at them later I felt disappointed. Writing this now I realise my in-gratitude and greed, perhaps some things will, perhaps should, elude the possibility of reproduction. Despite that, I am grateful that the photograph below serves as an ordinary reminder of what for me will always be an extraordinary walk in Suffolk.
