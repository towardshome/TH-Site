There is a saying, often attributed to the [Lakota people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people) that goes something like this: 

> Let everything you do be your religion, and everything you say your prayer.

I don't know if the saying originated with the Lakota (please let me know if you do) but its not hard to imagine the words being a response to the subjugation they suffered during the formation of the modern United States. Too often such subjugation has come from those professing belief in a religion the origin of which was love.

The saying gets its strength because it promises that a religious approach to life can and should be fully integrated into it. Our actions should always reflect our beliefs, and the lips that pray should not be the same lips that lie and speak unkindly of others.

It's a call to integrity, and therein lies its greatest appeal.
