One of the most satisfying things in photography is being at the 'right place at the right time', and for me this photograph represents that.

I took the photograph when returning home from work, and it has long been one of my favourites. The tower you can see on the hill is the [Jubilee Tower][1], a landmark photographed often in these parts!

I must confess that it is the theme of light overcoming the darkness that attracts me most to the photograph, and the sense of wonder that those shafts of light evoke.

One of the joys of photography is that, although it can document the most terrible things in life, it can also remind us of it's beauty.
