> We want to be taken by the hand,       
> Held securely as we might remember as a child.       
> We want to be told it will be alright.       
> That we are loved.     
>      
> We want to come home,     
> and be accepted.     
> Feel an unconditional love hold us,     
> That knows our failings but never mentions them.     
> Make them of no account.     
>      
> We want to  surrender privately,     
> To someone who knows our secrets.     
> To someone to whom we belong.     
> Who will never give us up.     
>      
> Donâ€™t try to be what you are not,     
> You are loved in eternity.     
> Stay close to home     
> to one who knows you best.
