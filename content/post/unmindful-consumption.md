For most of my life I have I have been unmindful about what I consume, and in that I know I am not alone. Too often I have taken more food and drink than I should, and too often I have not give enough consideration to where it came from, or the sacrifices and hard work that had to be made in order for me to enjoy it. I have not been mindful enough with other resources, in the electricity I have used, the things I have owned or the demand I have created for items I don't really need.

Unmindful consumption injures not only my own body and mind, but when multiplied a billion fold, the fabric of the earth itself. Our companions in the animal world suffer most.<!--more--> 

Yet it is not easy to disrupt this cycle. Despite our best intentions, despite all the above, it still remains difficult to do what we feel we should. Though our minds can be confused, our bodies too heavy and our souls unsettled we still too often give way and buy that item we don't need, eat when we're not hungry or give ourselves solace with that extra drink. 

And then there's the question of what we allow our minds to consume - the books we read for example, the films we see, the speech we listen to.

I am convinced that being mindful about what we consume is essential for our physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing. Much more importantly it is crucial to help our society, the animal world and the very planet on which we depend.

It's a difficult challenge.
