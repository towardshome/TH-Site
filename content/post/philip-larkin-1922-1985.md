Like many , Philip Larkin is one of my favourite poets. His poem 'Cut Grass' evokes the English summer as well as anything I've read.

> Cut grass lies frail:     
> Brief is the breath      
> Mown stalks exhale      
> Long, long the death      
> It dies in the white hours      
> Of young-leafed June      
> With chestnut flowers      
> With hedges snowlike strewn      
> White lilac bowed,      
> Lost lanes of Queen Anne’s lace      
> And that high-builded cloud      
> Moving at summer’s pace
