Brimham Rocks, located in North Yorkshire, is a rewarding place for photography and one I would recommend to anyone. The intriguing rock formations were formed by coarse-grained sandstone (known locally as Millstone Grit) being eroded over the millennia by glaciation, wind and water. Walking around the site reminded me of visiting a huge sculpture park, and I found the remarkable shapes of the rocks excited the imagination and offered an excellent study of form and texture.

The rocks lie in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and [details can be found at the National Trust website][1].

The above picture was taken in Autumn just before lunchtime, and I was lucky with the timing of the bird and the distant figures.
