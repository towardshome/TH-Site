I've been thinking about [my last post](/unmindful-consumption) on unmindful consumption. 

It's hard to write anything like that without it sounding overly austere and joyless, somehow a denial of pleasure. It's intended to be the reverse. It's meant to mean that by having less we will be more grateful and enjoy what we have even more.

<!--more-->

Doesn't our food always taste better when we are hungry and when we are thirsty do we not renew our appreciation for the purity of a glass of water? The simple and good pleasure of taking only what we need helps put us once again at an equilibrium with the world, and calms our soul.

Having a fair share means receiving more not less.
